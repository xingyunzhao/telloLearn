# Learn Tello Drone 

This is a learning project for [RYZE/DJI TELLO](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/tello) drone control 
with face tracking function. The starting code is based on a fantastic free online course provided 
by [CVZONE](https://www.computervision.zone/courses/drone-programming/). The author also posted the 
course vedio on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmEcyQnfpDA&ab_channel=Murtaza%27sWorkshop-RoboticsandAI)

Here is the demo video to show the face tracking function. It will be updated according to the 
project progress.
